Software Design
===============

Buzzer is activated with programming PWM signal at 3.5Khz.
AM2302 is one wire, Pin has to be changed from output to input.
fram has an SPI interface. It is harcoded in python as individual pins.
The core is the interrupt handler awaken by the discharges of the tube:

::

    import pyb
    import micropython

    count15m = 0
    count1m = 0

    # Interrupt service routine for input capture
    def ic_cb(tim):
        global count1m
        global count15m
        #ic_measure = ic.capture()
        count15m = count15m + 1
        count1m = count1m + 1

    def start():
        micropython.alloc_emergency_exception_buf(100)
        t2 = pyb.Timer(2,prescaler=1,period=8) #10.5MHz
        ic = t2.channel(4, pyb.Timer.IC, pin=pyb.Pin.board.Y10, polarity=pyb.Timer.FALLING)
        ic.callback(ic_cb)
